# FLOW Smart Contract
## Flovatar DustLender v0.1

This project is a submission for the September 2023 Cadence Competition    
https://flow.com/post/september-2023-cadence-competition

This smart contract aims to enhance the power of the Flovatar NFTs, a Flow blockchain that can be found here:    
https://flovatar.com/

Flovatar NFTs, thanks to the Flovatar team's ideas, can collect daily the $DUST token, project's native token, a FT on the Flow blockchain.

What this smart contract offers is to supply $DUST to a user, that equals to a Flovatar's $DUST/day times the selected amount of days (minus a service fee), by transferring the Flovatar the smart contract's deployer's wallet as collateral.
After the selected days have passed and the loaned amount of $DUST can be collected for the flovatar by the smart contract, the user can retrieve their Flovatar NFT back.

How such a service could help the flovatar owners?
- Provide instant liquidity of $DUST to buy anything from Packs to Psyche Likee
